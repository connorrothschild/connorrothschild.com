Awarded second place in the 2019 Houston Policy Challenge. Judged by Dwight Boykins, Houston city council member; Tory Gunsolley, president and CEO of the Houston Housing Authority; Amanda Timm, executive director of Local Initiatives Support Corporation; Tom McCasland, director of the City of Houston’s Housing and Community Development department and Stephan Fairfield, founder and CEO of Covenant Community Capital.

My team and I proposed a program which incentivizes homeowners in high-opportunity neighborhoods to construct ADUs & house voucher recipients. Our proposal prevents “NIMBYism” and community backlash to high-concentration public housing projects, and decentralizes low-income voucher recipients to high-opportunity neighborhoods.
