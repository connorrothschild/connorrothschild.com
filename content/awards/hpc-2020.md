Awarded first place (out of 13 teams) at Rice Universityâ€™s 2020 Houston Policy Challenge. Judged by Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Edison, Southern District of Texas, and Judge Franklin Bynum, Harris County Criminal Court at Law No. 8.

My partner and I proposed a pre-trial diversion program, 'New Path,' for pregnant women and mothers of young children.
