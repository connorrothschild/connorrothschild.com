# What it is

[**Mask Wearing in Your County**](https://observablehq.com/@connorrothschild/mask-wearing-in-your-county) is an Observable notebook that allows users to explore mask wearing in their county, compared to COVID-19 case counts and mask wearing in other counties.

# Tools used

This project was exclusively built with [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). The notebook contains a series of visualizations, each of which build upon the prior. Altogether, the intention is to tell a _story_ about masking, not just create a series of visuals.
