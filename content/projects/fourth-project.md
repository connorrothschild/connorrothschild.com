# What it is

**How Much Does Kid Cudi Hum?** is a visual storytelling piece centered around analyzing music's most famous hum. 

# Tools used

I used [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for all things visual and front-end. This was the first [scrollytelling](https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964) project I built, and I wanted an accessible way to approach scrollytelling so that it wouldn't get in the way of other stuff (such as making cool visuals and telling an actually interesting story). I had heard good things about Russell Goldenberg's [`Scrollama`](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama) and wanted to find an easy way to incorporate that library with Vue. I was able to do so with Vignesh Shenoy's [`vue-scrollama`](https://github.com/vgshenoy/vue-scrollama). It had a few quirks, but allowed me to quickly hit the ground running with scrollytelling capabilities.

# Overview (in my own words!)
