# What it is

[**Are You Smarter Than COMPAS?**](https://connorrothschild.github.io/compas/) is an application that allows users to explore how accurately they can predict recidivism, compared to a popular criminal justice sentencing algorithm known as COMPAS.

The application is meant to showcase how inaccurate COMPAS is, and illustrate that human judgment can more accurately assess risk than an algorithm that has sentenced millions behind bars.

# Tools used

This project was built using vanilla JavaScript, and styling was done with assistance from [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). It was rather easy to build; it was mostly an exercise to 1) inform users about how inaccurate sentencing algorithms are, and 2) learn JavaScript ðŸ™‚.
