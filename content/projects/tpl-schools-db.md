# What it is

[**The Texas School District COVID-19 Monitoring Dashboard**](http://news.rice.edu/2021/05/05/dashboard-developed-at-rice-will-help-texas-schools-open-safely-amid-pandemic/) was a dashboard built by my team at the Texas Policy Lab for Texas policymakers (and any other interested parties) to survey the landscape of COVID-19 in their school districts.

# Tools used

The app is built with R and is a Shiny web application. I was mostly responsible for the frontend development and some design. I helped less with the backend data retrieval, wrangling, and testing.
