# What it is

[**What Are You Doing Right Now?**](https://connorrothschild.github.io/what-are-you-doing/) is an application that leverages data from the American Time Use Survey to guess your current activities.

# Tools used

This project was built using vanilla JavaScript, and styling was done with assistance from [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). It was rather easy to build. It was one of my first JS projects and so it was mostly an attempt to learn ðŸ™‚.

Methodologically, for each demographic profile (a combination of race, age, marital status), I found the most common activities at every given time. (Technically, I grouped per hour to prevent issues with low N's). I would then display that activity to the user, given their parameters. If that didn't fit (according to the user), I would show the second most common activity, and so on!
