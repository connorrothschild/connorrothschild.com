# My Personal Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c43db3b2-6523-4b5a-ac2a-b743e42b93a7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/competent-mestorf-2d94ff/deploys)

My personal website, built from scratch using Vue/Nuxt.js. This site intends to be highly minimal, content-driven, and was built with special attention to accessibility. In contrast to my prior website, this site is server-side rendered, minimally uses animation, and is focused on speed. (My former website utilized flashy animations, images, and other perks at the expense of user loading times.) The site receives a 99/100 on Lighthouse tests (desktop view).
