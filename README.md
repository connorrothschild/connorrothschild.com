# My Personal Site

My personal website, built from scratch using Vue/Nuxt.js. This site intends to be highly minimal, content-driven, and was built with special attention to accessibility. In contrast to my prior website, this site is server-side rendered, minimally uses animation, and is focused on speed. (My former website utilized flashy animations, images, and other perks at the expense of user loading times.)

**Insert stats about performance here.**
